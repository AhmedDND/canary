Focus on it every single day, I wanna figure out a way<br />
To get ahead of what I think I know is coming<br />
It's obvious you got a problem if you always tryna make it seem<br />
As if you've never been afraid, then why you runnin'?<br />
I could never look at what I do the way that other people can<br />
And walk away, I can't be separated from it<br />
Stickin' out my neck is how I made it where I'm at<br />
You wanna cut it up but can't, man, they can never take it from me<br />
Outlandish, take chances<br />
Gotta get it while I can with my damage<br />
My sanity could leave but if it vanished<br />
Don't matter to me, I'd still manage<br />
Gue-guess you could say I'm at an advantage<br />
My vantage point can be quite lavish<br />
Got so many cadences<br />
No way to pick one, which bag is my hand in<br />
Depends what mood I'm in<br />
Oh, no, I'm in a mood again<br />
Lord knows I'm a hooligan<br />
Losin' it, who can get gruesome with<br />
You, if it comes down to what you can bet?<br />
I shoot direct, defuse the threat<br />
And they wonder why the music has a huge effect?<br />
Could it be 'cause I've been the go-to when it comes to depth?<br />
'Cause I'm the one that they be callin' when the people get fed up<br />
And want the music with the visuals, I got a vendetta<br />
For any part of me that wanna make it hard to get set up<br />
And take away the happiness, it can be kinda pathetic<br />
But when I look at everything that's tryna give me a headache<br />
I gotta be honest, I really been the cause of it, get it<br />
'Cause I can see a side of me you'll never see, you can tell when<br />
I'm at the breakin' point, I finally had to sit with the devil<br />
I went into hell and I asked him what the problem is yellin'<br />
He tried to get me to live with him, even called me a sinner<br />
And told me everything about me doesn't feel like a winner<br />
So why continue when he's tellin' me I might as well give up?<br />
I took a moment, thought about it, feelin' caught in the middle<br />
But got offended when he told me I would live in a kennel<br />
And I can never leave it, even if I made it to Heaven<br />
He'd find a way to get me back and send a demon to get me<br />
I'm like, "woah (woah), hold up, I don't think so"<br />
Skin and bones meet my ego<br />
How's he look? He don't eat much<br />
Let him starve, I don't feed him<br />
I just beat him, I just leave him in his womb, in a fetal<br />
Let him cry, let him yell, let him scream, I don't need him<br />
Lift off when I'm ticked off, my pitfalls I latch onto like a pit dog<br />
I sit calm with a sick thought of a sitcom of the life I live<br />
Life I live's more like a sci-fi flick<br />
I hide in, wanna watch? Dive right in<br />
My silence doesn't mean I'm dyin'<br />
Just means I'm careful with the time I spend, so<br />
(Look, look) Look what I, look what I done (Ayy)<br />
Helpin' 'em people I love (I love)<br />
My life is not what it was (no)<br />
I do whatever I must (woo)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (ayy)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (yeah)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (ayy)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (ayy)<br />
Tech N9na, next king up<br />
Everyone knowin' that I'm a death bringer<br />
That lingua vexing ya<br />
Leavin' a regular rapper resting, bruh (chyeah)<br />
This is what, I give it such<br />
An incredible wicked rush, a vivid gush<br />
Of poetical livid stuff to rid his gruff<br />
Said, I better go rip it rough and I lit it up<br />
The prestige I gather from people lovin' the Tech speed (whoop)<br />
Lyrically elect me, Jet Li<br />
The beat, it got ya bobbin' until your neck bleed (whoop)<br />
That is tellin' me, "Let's feed"<br />
On the bitter the bogus the hitter will focus<br />
Deliver the doses and give a critter the dopest<br />
Spitter to flow sick and now the quitter corrosive<br />
A swig of the roguish'll give your liver cirrhosis (chyeah)<br />
The boogie monster rappin' with NF in the hoodie<br />
Want to step into the session and fully conquer<br />
The weapon to lessen our profession go bully bonkers (chyeah)<br />
Left in a wreck, never checkin' nor could he stomp us<br />
Take his crown<br />
Thought he was gonna make us run away in a battle with his fakish frown<br />
Shake his ground<br />
Like I'm a Mechagodzilla, I'm such a killer when I break it down (uh)<br />
These flows are the cheat code for the weak Joes<br />
That need those Elite bros with the heat, so<br />
They can eat on the D low<br />
Off a beast yo' ego, got it vetoed (chyeah)<br />
Please close your beak foes, delete scrolls<br />
Taken from me, thiefs chose to try to decode (chyeah)<br />
Reload the beat, so I can reach each soul<br />
No cease, no finito, release (go!)<br />
I am the chosen and everyone is beholdin'<br />
My energy is golden 'cause dominion is being broken<br />
From enemies in the open approachin', I'm never jokin'<br />
The remedy bein' spoken, I'm hopin' that you're soakin' it up (chyeah)<br />
I'm in the motion, I'm dope and I'm never chokin'<br />
My devotion to floatin' like an ocean, the Holy Ghost and<br />
I'm scopin' the evil folk and revokin' the wicked notion<br />
I'm croakin', I'm really floatin' and quotin' that I'm closin' it up (chyeah)<br />
Talkin' behind my back<br />
End up where N9ne is at see me and say<br />
Kinda wack, you could not find the knack<br />
Hit you with a rhyme attack freely and spray<br />
I'ma beat you 'cause I'm greedy and slay, if you're creepy and cray<br />
I'ma eat you like PB&J, kiwi and grapes<br />
I'ma demolish 'em when the T be in play, pray!<br />
A stunna recordin' in my number three Jordans<br />
Dungaree sportin', the tongue on me is gonna be scorchin'<br />
The punishin' hunter eat like a hung-ary orphan (chyeah)<br />
T9 and NF are elephants<br />
In the room without a closet for skeletons<br />
Quit embellishin', a demon from hell is sent<br />
Yell it went, Donny, you're outta your element! (ayy)<br />
Look what I, look what I done (ayy)<br />
Helpin' 'em people I love (I love)<br />
My life is not what it was (no)<br />
I do whatever I must (woo)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (ayy)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (yeah)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (ayy)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (ayy)<br />
Look what I, look what I done (what I done)<br />
Helpin' 'em people I love (I love)<br />
My life is not what it was (no)<br />
I do whatever I must (woo)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (I trust, ayy)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (I trust, yeah)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust (ayy)<br />
Count on one hand who I trust<br />
